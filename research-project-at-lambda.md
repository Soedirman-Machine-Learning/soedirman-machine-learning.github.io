# Notes on research projects at Lambda-Lab

## Setup

- Create an Overleaf project, use *X-Y* as project title (replace `X` by `msc-thesis` or `bep` or your overarching research topic; replace `Y` by the specific topic of the paper/report) and invite me to it.
  - Every section/chapter gets at least two rounds of comments.
- Use GitHub to keep track of your project and add me to your project.
  - Add a `README.md` where you keep track of the meetings we had and what we discussed (action points to take).
  - Add a folder `papers` where you keep track of all the papers you read for your project.
  - Add a folder `code` to keep track of all your code. 
  - When you run any experiments, keep track of which code version you ran (use hash commits or tag the repo).
- For MSc thesis students only: make sure to submit the two required forms on time (one to form the thesis committee and one to fix the defense date).
- If several people work together on the project and aim for 1+ publications, settle on the order of authors at the start of the project. Note: it is possible to have several first authors on a paper with footnote such as *Equal contribution*.
